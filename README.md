Example Android app for testing Forza Telemetry.

This relies on https://github.com/dusanders/ForzaTelemetryAPI

Due to the Gradle settings on this app; we need to clone the API repo next to this project in your directory structure.

  - Or, you can update the Gradle file after clone and set your own path for API library

```
root project dir
...android_forza_telemetry
...ForzaTelemetryApi
```
